### üåü 4D Political Compass Quiz

**[DEPLOYMENT](https://alibekk93.github.io/4D-Political-Compass/)**

This is a simple React application that maps your political beliefs across four key dimensions: **Economic**, **Authoritarian**, **Traditionalism**, and **Globalism**. Answer a series of questions on a sliding scale to find out where you stand, and then compare your results to a database of historical and contemporary political figures.

I once tried to find my political home using a standard 2D compass. The results were... unhelpful. I ended up somewhere in the ideological suburbs, right next to a confused squirrel who also couldn't figure out if he was a classical liberal or just really into burying things. That's when I realized: you need more than two axes to explain why I want a free market but also demand that everyone puts their shopping carts back. The universe is a messy place, and my political beliefs, apparently, require at least four dimensions to make any sense at all.
